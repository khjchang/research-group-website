            Digital Design-Test-Verification and Fault Tolerance Research Group focuses on the
            comprehensive lifetime validation of digital systems that uses fabrication fault testing
            and simulation techniques and accounts for design errors, fabrication faults, and
            operational faults. The specific contributions of his research activities include: (1)
            efficient techniques for gate-level and high-level simulation-based design verification,
            (2) new post silicon verification methods that improve the observability of internal
            signals within complex digital systems, (3) several on-line testing techniques for the
            detection of operational faults during normal operation, (4) various approximate and
            exact global fault collapsing techniques that drastically reduce the number of modeled
            faults, and (5) new implementation-independent functional test generation techniques
            that extract good sets of functional vectors.
